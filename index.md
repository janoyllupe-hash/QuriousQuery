Welcome to QuriousQuery, a blog where I chronicle my queries into the world. 
I try to ask questions about, for the lack of a better term, my soul, the world, and evetything in between, sometimes deep, sometimes disturbing.


If the whole world is an [interface](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26384988/), what would you query into it?
